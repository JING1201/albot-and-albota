# Wanted features

Feel free to add ideas to this list

- Polls
  - Secret voting by messaging the bot a code
  - Regular open voting using emoji
  - Some way of enforcing only voting once
- Meeting Sign-In
  - Have a way for club members to sign in by messaging the bot or saying a command
  - Should have a way for admin to view the list
  - Store the sign-ins in a database of some sorts
  - Let the admin create meetings for users to sign into
- Events from Google Calendar
  - Load events from Google Calendar
  - Notify users in the annoucements channel before events
  - Let the admins configure the frequency of the notifications
- Project Management
  - Some sort of way to propose projects for the admin to approve
    - The bot could then create roles, a channel, maybe even a repo...
  - @roles for new issues on GitHub (potentially annoying)
  - Let users query what projects there are and join the role
